## Tips 
Try experimenting with Comparison Opperators (!, ===, <>, ect) in the NODE REPL. 

Note launches with the 'node' command in Vagrant. 

Work on code iteratively. 

Try to output the values of "hungry" and "avaliableTime" in the Terminal with the following. 

''' function whatToDoForLunch(hungry,availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("avaliableTimeis", avaliableTime);
}
'''
